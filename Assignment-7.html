    <h1>Audio tag</h1>
  <p>  <pre>
        The <audio> tag is used to embed sound content in a document, such as music or other audio streams.

            The <audio> tag contains one or more <source> tags with different audio sources. The browser will choose the first source it supports.
            
            The text between the <audio> and </audio> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <audio> element.
            
            There are three supported audio formats in HTML: MP3, WAV, and OGG.
        </pre></p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
    <audio controls> 
        <source src="song.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">

    </audio>
