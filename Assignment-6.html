            <h2> Artificial Inteligence</h2>
            <p> Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems capable of performing complex tasks that historically only a human could do, such as reasoning,
                making decisions, or solving problems. 
                Today, the term “AI” describes a wide range of technologies that power many of the services and goods we use every day 
                from apps that recommend tv shows to chatbots that provide customer support in real time. But do all of these really constitute artificial intelligence 
                as most of us envision it? And if not, then why do we use the term so often? 
                In this article, you’ll learn more about artificial intelligence, what it actually does, and different types of it.
                In the end, you’ll also learn about some of its benefits and dangers and explore flexible courses that can help you expand your knowledge of AI even further.  </p>
